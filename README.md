### Introduction
This is the README file for the `github events analysis` project.

In this project I will aggregate events extracted from GitHub in order to
extract metrics to allow us to get a picture of what repositories
are used the most and who is using them.

### Details
The language chosen for this project is `python`. Pyspark will also be used,
since large amounts of data are expected.

The data chosen for this project corresponds to January 2022 and they can be
accessed through https://www.githubarchive.org/.

### Branches
The first branch that was created in this repository was there just to get
started. The `master` branch has been created in order to hold this `README`
file.

The procedure to follow is the usual: create a new feature branch every time
you want to add a feature to the code and go through the PR process.

### How do I run the code?
