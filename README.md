### Introduction
This is the README file for the `github events analysis` project.

In this project I will aggregate events extracted from GitHub in order to
extract metrics to allow us to get a picture of what repositories
are used the most and who is using them.

### Details
The language chosen for this project is `python`. Pyspark will also be used,
since large amounts of data are expected.

The data chosen for this project corresponds to January 2022 and they can be
accessed through https://www.githubarchive.org/.

### How do I run the code?
